# Learning-YAML

1. YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

2. Technically YAML is a superset of JSON.

### NOTE:

I made this repository from a YAML crash course. You will find all of these code in [index.yaml](https://github.com/TaenAhammed/Learning-YAML/blob/master/index.yaml) file.
